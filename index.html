    <h1>Student Bio</h1>
    
    <h2>Patrick Ceriale</h2>
    <p>My name is Patrick Ceriale and I grew up in Santa Barbara, California with a house full of dogs, including my older brother Chris. I left town to go to college at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, CA where I got my Bachelor's Degree in Biology. After college I got into the Craft Beer industry where I worked for Ballast Point Brewing Company, Telegraph Brewing Company and Urban Family Brewing Company. After 8.5 years and a global pandemic, I wanted a career change and enrolled in the University of Washington Coding Bootcamp where I am currently studying to become a Web Developer! I live in Seattle, WA with my wife Flannery and my dog Poppy. Poppy can usually be found napping, eating or thinking about napping and/or eating.</p>
